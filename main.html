      <h4 class= "TermsTitle">Key Terms</h4>
      <p>
        Some key terms you should know while learning about Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and their applications are as follows:
          <ul class= "KeyTerms">

      <h4 class= "AppTitle">Agriculture</h4>
      <p class= "AppDesc">
        The incorporation of UAVs is a growing trend in agriculture, as it enables precise crop management that can boost
production and save farmers millions of dollars in time and resources. UAVs also provides farmers with a cost efficient
way to spray for pests and diseases, manage their crops, and check for signs of drought and blight. American Scientists have begun using small remote-controlled UAVs to help farmers detect diseases and
stress in their crops. The UAVs take photographs and measurements that allow farmers to keep an eye on
their large fields. Japan uses more than 2,000 miniature UAVs to spray difficult to reach rice fields, while also
monitoring the health of the crops

      <h4 class= "AppTitle">Search and Rescue</h4>
      <p class= "AppDesc">
        UAVs can play an invaluable role in analyzing and mitigating the harsh impacts that can come Mother Nature, and man himself alike. Natural disasters such as volcanoes present conditions too dangerous to observe with manned vehicles.
Manmade disasters such as leaks at a nuclear power plant also prove too hazardous for humans, making data collection
difficult and slowing the response. Under human control and operated remotely, UAVs can enter hazardous spaces for
long periods of time in a way that humans simply never could. Some examples of UAVs being able to help when humans could not are: After the 2011 earthquake and resulting tsunami that impacted Japan, unmanned vehicles were used to
conduct surveillance and check radiation levels at the damaged Fukushima Nuclear plant, which was too
hazardous for humans to approach. Another exampleis when the University of Alaska demonstrated the use of a 3-pound unmanned aircraft that could gather 3-D aircraft
data to aid oil spill cleanup efforts and ensure minimal environmental impact. UAVs were dispatched after Hurricane Katrina, able to search for people stranded by floodwaters much more
quickly than emergency responders who ventured out in rowboats. In 2010, researchers at the University of North Dakota used UAVs to capture real time images of the flooded Red
River in the upper Midwest and provided data absolutely necessary for flood research, rescue, and planning.

      <h4 class= "AppTitle">Delivery</h4>
      <p class= "AppDesc">
        Delivery and transportation of goods is another use of drones that is currently in research and development. Delivery services,
such as Amazon through its Prime Air program, are experimenting with their use as a means of delivery. Additionally, multiple
food companies are looking into drone delivery. The Tacocopter is a taco delivery service utilizing a smartphone app to deliver
tacos in the San Francisco area. An independent branch of Dominos in Britain has also experimented with drone delivery using
their DomiCopter.
      However, there are also instances of drones being used for more nefarious purposes. There were four incidents of drones being
used to smuggle contraband into prisons in the 2013-2015 period. Drug cartels have also used GPS-guided drones to transport
contraband.
      There are multiple barriers preventing drones in the commercial sector and our daily lives from becoming a reality, however.
Issues regarding regulation and legality of the drones and the possibility of the drones being intercepted and the goods stolen 
are both keeping this from becoming reality. These are being worked on in the present time, however, and they are
hypothesized to be a presence within the year, as the legislation should be worked out by June, 2016.

      <h4 class= "AppTitle">Scientific Research</h4>
      <p class= "AppDesc">
        UAVs will provide new vantage points for researchers, giving them perspectives humans haven't been able to see before. UAVs also remove
the risk researchers previously faced while flying in helicopters through hazardous conditions or over difficult terrains. NASA is equipping two UAVs with the most advanced weather equipment on the planet as part of a three-year
project to study hurricanes, which may unlock the secret as to why tropical storms transform into lethal
hurricanes. After a group of associates were killed in a helicopter accident, an Idaho biologist led an effort to invest in UAVs to
count salmon nests in Idaho waterways. Not only does the use of UAVs make the research safer, it also can be
less expensive, saving critical research funding.

      <h4 class= "AppTitle">Environmental Protection</h4>
      <p class= "AppDesc">
        Environmental organizations and governments can use unmanned aircraft systems to monitor forests for illegal logging that leads to deforestation,
protect green space, observe wildlife and monitor erosion. UAVs also examine power plants and other structures for leaks
that could pose environmental risks. Nicholls State University is testing a new kind of unmanned aircraft to track coastal erosion and the health of
Louisiana’s barrier islands, which are an important habitat for migratory birds, as well as a frontline protection
against hurricanes. Scientists working with the WWF are using unmanned aircraft to monitor areas for poaching and
other illegal activities. In June 2012, two unmanned aircraft equipped with GPS and a camera, were tested in
Nepal’s Chitwan National Park, home to endangered tigers and rhnocerouses. Researchers hope
the added eyes will help their efforts to detect and prevent the poaching of these animals. NASA researchers in California and Nevada have used unmanned aircraft to collect very low altitude airborne measurements
of greenhouse gases, saying the new aircraft capability has the potential to provide critical measurements of
carbon fluxes. The research will assist scientists in their understanding of carbon dioxide cycling between the
land, ocean and atmosphere.
