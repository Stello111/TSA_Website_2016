      <h3>Delivery</h3>
      <p>Delivery and transportation of goods is another use of drones that is being researched right now. Multiple corporations,
      such as Amazon through its Prime Air program, are experimenting with this use. There are multiple barriers preventing this
      from becoming a reality, however. Issues regarding regulation and legality of the drones and the possibility of the drones
      being intercepted and the goods stolen are both keeping this from becoming reality.</p>
