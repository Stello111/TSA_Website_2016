    <h3>The Problem Posed</h3>
    <p>The logistical problem posed to us by the Technology Student Association this year is how to recycle and process used electronics. This problem is one that we feel must be addressed in the near future due to the fact that technology is doubled every 18 months and therefore the "obsolete" technology is simply gotten rid of, but can be reused.</p>
