  <p class = solid>Hello, this is us. We are three students at Belton High School getting ready to complete our Sophomore year. We are Micheal Dickerson (right), Jake Zink (middle), and Aidan Freeman (left.) We are also a part of the Belton robotics team; 7232. We are all very different, and we're all glad for TSA because it allows us opprutunties to explore our fields.
  
  Micheal is wanting to go to school for Mechanical Engineering, probably and Missouri Science and Technology. His hobbies include guitar, hanging out with friends, and video games. He likes TSA because it helps him further explore what very well could be his future profession.
  
 
  Jake is wanting to go to school farther away. His hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons, RPG video games, and being allergic to peanut butter. He likes TSA because it gives him oppritunuties that help hm reach his goals.
  
 
  Aidan is wanting to go to school either in Washington or London, for Psychiatry. His hobbies include hangng out with the other two, video games, and watching movies. He likes TSA because it allows him to meet new and interesting people, he alos likes TSA because it allows him to learn new things.</p>
