  <p class = solid>Hello, this is us. We are three students at Belton High School getting ready to complete our Sophomore year. We are Michael Dickerson (left), Jake Zink (middle), and Aidan Freeman (right) We are also a part of the Belton robotics team; 7232. We are all very different, and we're all glad for TSA because it allows us opportunties to explore our desired fields.
  
  Micheal is wanting to go to school for Mechanical Engineering, and would like to attend Missouri S&T. His hobbies include guitar, hanging out with friends, and video games. He likes TSA because it helps him further explore what very well could be his future profession.
  
 
  Jake is wanting to go to school far away from home for the experience. His hobbies include DnD, RPG video games, and being allergic to nuts. He likes TSA because it gives him an outlet for his creativity and a place to apply what he learns in the classroom.
  
 
  Aidan is wanting to go to school either in Washington or London, for Psychiatry. His hobbies include hangng out with the other two, video games, and watching movies. He likes TSA because it allows him to meet new and interesting people, he also likes TSA because it allows him to learn many new things.</p>
