  <h2>TSA at BHS</h2>
  <p class= "solid"> Here at Belton High School, every member of our team participates in VEX Robotics in some capacity. This year at the high school we had six teams. Of these six teams, three made it to Vex Worlds and competed just mere days ago. Of our three teams, two of them made it in the top twenty for their divison, and the third was ranked fifty-first. Last year we got second in VEX at TSA Nationals and another team, consisting of this website's creators, got seventh in Leadership Strategies. At the state level, Belton took first place in seven events and got top three in many more. for mreo information about our chapter, click the following link: http://belton7232.wix.com/cyberpirates7232 </p>
